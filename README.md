# Project Introduction
This project was completed as part of the admissions process to Vilnius University from April 22-24, 2025. I was given 48 hours to clean and come up with a compelling story about the dataset, which was a dataset tracking movements of ships on the Baltic Sea. The final outputs were my code and a powerpoint presentation, which I presented during the interview on April 24, 2025.

# Objective
The goal of this assignment was to evaluate foundational knowledge in data science, including data analysis, statistics, and modeling, in addition to assessing problem-solving skills, critical thinking, and the ability to communicate insights in a creative manner. 

# Guidelines:
1. Explore and Understand the Data 

2. Develop a Creative Analytical Theme or direction

3. Data Preparation - Demonstrate your ability to clean and preprocess data for meaningful analysis:

4. Choose a modeling task aligned with your theme 

5. Deliver Your Story
